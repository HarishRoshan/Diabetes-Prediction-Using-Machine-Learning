Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Description
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict diabetes outcomes based on the provided features. The dataset used contains various health-related attributes, such as age, blood pressure, and glucose levels. Our goal is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether an individual is diabetic or not based on these features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the diabetes.csv file, which includes medical data for individuals, with a binary target variable indicating whether or not the individual has diabetes.

Columns in the Dataset:
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body Mass Index (kg/m^2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function that indicates the likelihood of diabetes based on family history)

Age: Age (in years)

Outcome: Target variable indicating whether the person has diabetes (1) or not (0)

Objective
To build a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes using various features. We focus on achieving a high accuracy, utilizing techniques such as:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and balancing the dataset using SMOTE.

Modeling: Using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Model Tuning: Optimizing model performance using techniques like Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning.

Tools & Libraries
Python: Programming language used for analysis and modeling.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE): For oversampling the minority class.

Results
After implementing data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of approximately 90%, showing promising results for predicting diabetes outcomes.
